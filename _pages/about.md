Hello, everyone! Here is **Bingyang Guo (Aries, 郭冰洋)**'s academic page.

# 🧍‍♂️ Biography

I am pursuing my PhD degree in the Software College at the [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/) (Shenyang, China), advised by [Prof. Ruiyun Yu](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yury/). I received the bachelor's degree in the School of Mechanical Engineering at the [Shenyang Ligong University](https://www.sylu.edu.cn/), and the master's degree in the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation at the [Northeastern University](https://www.neu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yunhui Yan](http://team.neu.edu.cn/MVR/zh_CN/more/263427/tdld/index.htm) and [Prof. Kechen Song](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/songkechen/zh_CN/index.htm), within [Machine Vision & Robotics Lab](http://team.neu.edu.cn/MVR).

My academic interests revolve around AI4Industry, especially focus on **Industrial Surface Defect Segmentation under Data-scarcity Scenarios**, including Zero/Few-shot segmentation, Wealy-supervised segmentation, 2D-3D visual fusion, and Large Vision Model. If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - wxqmdr [at] gmail.com
